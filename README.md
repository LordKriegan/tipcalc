The best tip calculator, EVER! It shows how much you love your wait staff! :D

I did this in React, and used a couple of packages (react-bootstrap and react-icons). I absolutely did not need to; this could have easily been done in simple HTML/CSS/JS but the reason I chose to do it this way is because I have never used the react-bootstrap package before and I figured this would be a great way to learn and get used to it! react-icons was just for the awesome looking heart. 

Though it wasn't deployed, I also made a non-react version. You can find it in the repository under tipcalcnoreact.
